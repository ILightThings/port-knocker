# port-knocker
Port knocker with permutations of input port numbers

Usage: python knock.py <ip> <port1> <port2> <port3><br>
Ex: python knock.py 192.168.209.130 1 2 3<br>

The first time I came across the idea of port knocking was during my days in the PWK labs (OSCP). Had a hard time understanding why scripts publicly available in the internet were not working until I had to see the traffic in Wireshark myself. Has to be similar with the screenshot below.
